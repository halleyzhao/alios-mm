1
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,090
Get those people out of the way!        Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,290
The president has been shot!

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
There were at least three gunshots. 

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,660
There appear to be at least...

5
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,830
Get those people out of the fucking way. Let's go!

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,270
I'm all right.

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,500
To the van. Let's go! Let's go!

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
Was anyone else hit?

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,900
Go! Go! Go! Go!

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,450
Call my wife. Tell her I'm okay.        He got through security.

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,240
Repeat, he got through security.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,150
Tell her I'm okay.        We will, Mr. President.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,210
God damn it!        We'll call her.

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,960
MSNBC has confirmed that a few minutes ago,

15
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,260
US war planes struck military bases in Venezuela

16
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,810
in retaliation for the assassination attempt 

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,160
on President Lyman three weeks ago.

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,760
Our Emily Boyd is on the ground in Caracas.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,860
Emily, what are you hearing now?

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,030
Jim, as you can imagine, the situation on the ground in Caracas

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,870
can be described as a state of chaos.

22
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,410
Apparently, President Lyman responded to a CIA report

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,510
said to have overwhelmingly and conclusively asserted

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,710
Venezuela's involvement in the assassination attempt.

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,850
President Lopez's government...

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,160
* Four bottles of milk on the wall Four bottles of milk *

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,770
* You take one down, *

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,730
* you pass it around Three bottles of milk on the wall *

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,200
* Three bottles of milk on the wall *

30
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,670
Oh, my god! The song!

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,070
Is this what we got in trouble for in Abu Ghraib?

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,180
I don't know why anybody actually signed up to be a room mother.

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,370
Yeah.

34
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,450
Hey, Timmy!

35
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,020
What are you doing?        Sorry, Mom.

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,460
Can you just, like, sing along with everybody else?

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,590
I don't have a good voice.

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,430
Well, me, neither. Come on, sing along.

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,970
Come on.

40
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,270
Mrs. Robinson?        Yeah, what is it, dear?

41
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,900
Nicky Ludlow keeps pulling on my hair, and he won't stop.

42
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,910
Well, just switch seats.

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,880
But the bus is full.

44
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,510
You know what, just stay right here. Okay? I'll deal with it.

45
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,280
You're a tattletale!

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,980
I am not!        You just told on Nicky.

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,220
That's because he won't stop.

48
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,260
You're a tattletale.        Timmy, that's enough. Stop it.

49
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,700
That's enough.        But you're not supposed to tattle.

50
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,640
Well, you're not supposed to 

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,720
have to put up with bullies, either.

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,800
Come on.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,360
Capital Sun Times.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,970
It's gonna be the Redskins.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,710
You know what you call 53 people watching the Super Bowl?

56
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,440
No, sir.        The Washington Redskins.

57
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,780
That's what you call them.

58
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,340
Larry, you should be supporting the home team.

59
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,910
I would support the North Koreans

60
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,480
if they were playing the Washington Redskins.

61
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,340
All right, Judy, give it four hours 

62
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,350
as top story on the Net, I guess.

63
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,150
Thank you, B.B.        That's it, boss. I think.

64
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,590
Okay. Thanks, everybody. Let's make it a good one.

65
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,860
Let me ask you a question.

66
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,190
 How many Olympians do we have in town?

67
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,460
Oh, quite a few.

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,570
Rache, stick around a minute, would you?

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,270
You know there's that track star, right? From Georgetown?

70
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,740
Yeah.        Okay, get on him, too, all right?

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,710
Get the door for me, would you, Kelly?        No problem.

72
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,010
Thanks.

73
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,750
Okay, Rache.

74
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,720
We're gonna fast track the story. Your story.

75
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,780
Really? When?

76
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,850
The New York Times has gotten hold of some of the information,

77
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,950
so we're going to beat them to the punch.

78
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,360
Yeah. Want to get it on the doorsteps tomorrow.

79
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,300
I mean, it's a killer story.

80
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,900
No, I know. It's Watergate. 

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,200
It's Iran-Contra.

82
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,670
It mean, it's a 'holy shit' piece, Bonnie.

83
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,300
It's gonna take them down.        Rachel.

84
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,740
Sorry. Gotta rein it in. I'm kind of excited.

85
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,310
Okay, we gotta remain objective.

86
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,840
Well, fine. We'll objectively bring down the White House.

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,210
What else do you need to do to finish the story?

88
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,300
I gotta call the White House. 

89
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,380
Of course, go to Van Doren herself.

90
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,480
Out of curiosity, why haven't you spoken to her yet?

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,290
Avril, I already told you,

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
if we went to her too early, 

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,760
we give the CIA time to shut the story down.

94
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,890
We go now, there's nothing they can do.

95
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,900
Okay. Look, legally the story is solid.

96
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,300
Everything is factually in line. There's no libel.

97
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,310
Well, that's all that's important, right?

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,240
I wish you would let me know who your source is on this.

99
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,710
A title, a job description.

100
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,150
Okay, look, we have two confirming sources.

101
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,780
Rachel told me who they are, and I'm comfortable with them.

102
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,880
We have Van Doren's letter to the CIA director

103
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,550
that the Feds gave to Rachel.

104
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,870
That's enough to go to press.

105
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,720
It's your flip of the coin.

106
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,230
I'm just saying that what you guys are okay with,

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,030
the government may not be. The laws are murky.

108
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry, what?

109
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,630
It's illegal for a government official

110
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,300
to reveal the identity of an undercover CIA agent.

111
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,740
Okay. Well, I'm not a government official.

112
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,470
I don't understand why you're bringing... You know what?

113
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,310
We've already discussed this. Bonnie's signed off on it.

114
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,750
As long as we all know what we're dealing with.

115
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,150
All right, we know.

116
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,650
Okay, do you know how to find her? Van Doren?

117
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,620
Yeah. I'll go to her as soon as I get out of here.

118
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,590
Our kids go to school together, if you can believe that.

119
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,630
No shit?        Yeah.

120
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,750
Okay, you feel comfortable going to her for comment?

121
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,200
Absolutely.

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,590
Yeah! That's it! Come on! Pass it in!

123
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,900
Stay open, Ali!        Angela, pass it to me.

124
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,630
I got it! I got it!

125
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,800
Come on now! Push up! Push up!

126
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,840
Yes, Ali! Good job! Good job!

127
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,800
Kick it, honey! Kick it hard!

128
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Good pass!

129
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,650
Spread out, girls! Spread out!

130
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
Get in there! Come on!

131
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,860
Hey.        Hello.

132
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,730
Oh, no. Defense! Come on, defense! Allison.

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,460
She's doing great out there.        Yeah.

134
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,210
Every one of them chases the ball.

135
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,430
Well, nobody likes defense.

136
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,140
Come on, Ali! Come on.

137
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,310
She is in Mr. Cody's class. Right?        Yeah.

138
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,940
Yeah, my son, too.        Oh, I see.

139
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,550
Come on, Allison.        There you go, there you go, honey!

140
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,590
Could we talk in private?

141
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm with the Sun Times, I need a few minutes.

142
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,290
It's kind of important.

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,760
Yeah. Sure.

144
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,460
I'm just concerned she might have seen me slip away.

145
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,510
I won't keep you long.        Okay. So, what's up?

146
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,610
Erica, I'm writing a story. I work for the national desk.

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,110
Okay? Neat.

148
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,690
And it's gonna run tomorrow, 

149
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,810
and it's gonna say, among other things,

150
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,080
that you are a CIA operative,

151
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,440
and that you went on a mission, 

152
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,450
a fact-finding mission to Venezuela.

153
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,920
What? This is...

154
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,690
Hear me out, okay?

155
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,120
You went there on a fact-finding mission

156
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,930
to determine if its government was responsible

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,360
for the assassination attempt on President Lyman.

158
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,160
You determined it was not, and you informed your bosses of this.

159
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,430
This is the stupidest B.S. I have ever heard.

160
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,340
Wait, wait. What? Can you...

161
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,000
How do I know that you're from the Sun Times?

162
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,130
The White House ignored your findings 

163
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,380
and launched an attack anyway,

164
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,250
still claiming retribution for the assassination attempt.

165
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,380
I've been on the national desk for five years.

166
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,850
I have a column every Tuesday on the editorial page.

167
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,420
My son goes to school here, too.

168
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,620
Yeah, I know. You said that.

169
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,560
You people.

170
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,830
You people! My God! You fucking people!

171
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,060
You know, this isn't about me. 

172
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,700
Once again, it's about my husband.

173
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,100
My source is impeccable.

174
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,800
Your source is 110% fucking peccable.

175
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm a CIA operative?

176
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,170
I can't even use the navigation system in my Prius. 

177
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,480
This is... This is absurd!

178
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,970
Your paper... 

179
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,580
Your paper has been trying to fuck my husband

180
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,560
ever since he spoke out against this administration.

181
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,020
We have your memo.        What memo?

182
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,070
We have your findings.

183
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,060
You know. My attorney is Harry Timmers.

184
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,820
Do you know him?        Sure.

185
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,090
He's gonna take a lead pipe to you, 

186
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,090
and he's gonna shove it up your ass.

187
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,600
Well, I certainly don't want that.

188
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,590
What are you doing? What are you doing? 

189
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,260
Our kids go to school together, Robin.

190
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,330
Rachel Armstrong.        Right. Whatever.

191
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,530
Are you denying you're CIA?

192
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,270
You know what? You stay away from us. Okay? I mean it.

193
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,620
Just say that the White House 

194
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,910
doesn't comment on security issues.

195
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,790
Is that what you're saying?

196
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,480
Come on, David. Give me something I can spell.

197
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
Off the record, this is bullshit.

198
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,630
You're gonna set off a shit storm for nothing,

199
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,720
for a lousy column inch of space.

200
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,960
Rachel, it's your son on line five.

201
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,460
You're gonna have egg on your face.

202
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,830
I gotta go, David. I got my son on the other line.

203
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,430
Hey, kiddo.

204
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,770
Hi, Mom. Did you get my paper?

205
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,810
Yeah, I'm just getting it now. Can I read it and call you back?

206
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,400
Okay, but I gotta go to bed soon.

207
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,010
Okay. Well, you can wait up for me to call you.

208
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,520
But Dad said I had to go to bed.

209
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,110
Well, we'll do it in the morning. I promise.

210
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,250
Okay.

211
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,260
It's just, I have a real big story, honey.

212
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,120
It's fine, Mom.

213
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,360
Okay, I love you. Bye-bye.

214
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,520
Sorry.        Hey, what's that?

215
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,940
My son had to do a paper on India. 

216
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,160
I was just looking over his outline.

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,620
I bet you he could give me 10 inches 

218
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,730
on India's nuclear buildup with Pakistan.

219
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,600
Oh, yeah.        How'd you do with David?

220
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,770
'White House doesn't comment on security issues.' Blah-blah.

221
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,650
Yeah, well, 

222
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,300
I know you'll give it more eloquent phrasing than 'blah-blah.'

223
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,250
Sure.        Feels good, huh?

224
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,950
It's worth every dime I don't make.

225
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,680
Look, I want you to start on a major profile of Van Doren,

226
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
from Yale to CIA, 

227
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,130
to the marriage to the ambassador 20 years older than her.

228
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,360
He was her professor. He was married. A whole drama, I hear.

229
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,560
Now, that's some good stuff.

230
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,090
Look, by the way, you deserve a good night's sleep.

231
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,300
If I were you, I'd turn the ringers on my phone off.

232
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,310
Hey, Erica.

233
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,030
Why are we meeting here, Merrill?

234
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,010
For the chili.

235
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,120
No. Why are we meeting out in the open like this?

236
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,490
We're not out in the open, Erica. No one knows who you are.

237
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,080
Now tomorrow, when that goddamn story comes out,

238
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,100
tomorrow you'll be out in the open. Shit!

239
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,890
Your husband had to go and write those articles, didn't he?

240
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,090
Keep him out of this.

241
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,190
You're right, Erica. It's not Oscar's fault.

242
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,770
Oscar hasn't been trained in covert ops. 

243
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,400
Oscar didn't take an oath of secrecy.

244
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,810
No, it's your fault. You shouldn't have told him anything.

245
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,840
Okay, hey, guys. Here's the SITREP.

246
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,290
The paper will be out in two hours. 

247
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,280
They haven't put it up on the Net.

248
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,010
They didn't want to give the West Coast papers a chance

249
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,750
to put it in their morning editions. And Justice is scrambling.

250
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,280
They're bringing in a special prosecutor 

251
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,320
to find out who exposed you.

252
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,230
I can't believe this.

253
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,560
I mean, our kids go to school together,

254
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,600
you know, the reporter's kid and mine.

255
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,700
Wait a second. You know her?

256
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,330
Well, I kind of recognized her today, 

257
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,940
but we'd never spoken before that moment.

258
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,910
Let me ask you straight out, Erica. Was it you?

259
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,920
Was it me, what?        Was it you who leaked to the Sun Times?

260
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,580
I mean, it's understandable.

261
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,140
The White House ignored your report, and you got pissed.

262
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,750
You goaded Oscar to write those quote-unquote, opinion pieces.

263
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,730
When that didn't get traction, you went to the press yourself.

264
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,230
I went to the press myself.

265
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,960
Someone you knew. Someone you trusted.

266
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,860
Fuck you.

267
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,760
Fuck me? Touch?

268
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,270
The prosecutor, Patton Dubois, he'll be in tomorrow.

269
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,930
He'll get Armstrong before the grand jury.

270
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,950
Law says Armstrong has to give up her source.

271
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,280
Could it have been Oscar?

272
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,870
No. Could it have been you, O'Oara?

273
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,290
How we all doing? Still doing good?

274
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,580
Doing good.        You sure?

275
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,320
Good.        All right.

276
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,450
I'm gonna put you on the box. Oscar, too.

277
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,550
Fine. But I want everybody in the agency who knows my identity,

278
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,590
I want them with polygraph wires up their asses, too,

279
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,930
because there's a traitor among us.

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,370
We'll find that person if they're in the CIA.

281
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,450
Nonetheless, we should think about 

282
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,670
relocating you for your own good.

283
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,570
No. No. I will send Allison away for a little while,

284
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,670
but none of this shit was my fault. I'm not gonna be punished.

285
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,350
This Lois Lane and her newspaper,

286
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm not gonna let her turn me into a scared little girl.

287
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm staying here.

288
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,290
Whatever.

289
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,880
In the meantime, we'll assign a protective detail to your home.

290
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,860
I feel so much safer. Thank you.

291
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,800
I can't fucking believe this.

292
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,940
Mommy.

293
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,780
Wanna stay home from school today?        Yeah.

294
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,090
This is very interesting. It's awesome.

295
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,460
Thank you.        You're welcome. Wow.

296
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,030
I didn't realize they made so much coffee in India.

297
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,290
It also has the most democrats in the world.

298
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,830
Well, not quite. India is the biggest democracy in the world.

299
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,600
Isn't that the same thing?        No, it's not the same thing.

300
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,170
Jesus Christ.

301
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,180
Don't give your carrots to Brandon today. Okay?

302
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,840
Okay, Mom.

303
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,050
You did it.

304
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,720
This changes everything. You're gonna win a Pulitzer.

305
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,620
I don't know about that.

306
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,830
Timmy, come on. Eat your breakfast.        I don't like them.

307
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
Come on, don't give Mommy a hard time. Finish your eggs.

308
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,340
Eggs give you cancer.        Eggs don't give you cancer.

309
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,310
All right, you know what? I'll finish your cancer, okay. Okay?

310
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,840
Feels pretty good though. That was a lot of work.

311
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,050
You didn't tell me half the stuff that's in here.

312
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,700
Well, you don't tell me anything 

313
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,620
that goes into your novels, so it's fair.

314
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,320
A spokesman for the newspaper says

315
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,920
because her husband is a vocal opponent of the administration,

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,880
this makes Mrs. Van Doren's employment 

317
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,030
with the CIA absolutely newsworthy.

318
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,070
Mom?        In Mexico City...

319
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,400
What's up, kiddo?        Can we go to the zoo today?

320
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,110
To the zoo? It's a school day.

321
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,080
Maybe we can go tonight?

322
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,450
Well, the animals are sleeping at night.

323
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,210
You don't want to mess with sleeping animals.

324
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,310
They might be a bit cranky.

325
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,960
Okay, come on, sweetie, you're gonna be late.

326
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,790
You got your stuff?        You want to finish it?

327
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,520
Great, thank you.

328
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,640
Hey. Come on, you're forgetting. Give me a kiss.

329
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,440
I love you. Have a good day.

330
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,810
Hey, Connor.

331
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,480
I'm sorry, you scared the hell out of me.

332
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,990
I'm Special Agent Coddington. I'm with the FBI.

333
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,350
We need you to come with us, please.

334
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,600
What for?

335
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,550
I don't know, ma'am. 

336
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,920
They just asked me to come here and pick you up.

337
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,660
Hey there, Miss Armstrong. Come on in.

338
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm Patton Dubois, federal prosecutor.

339
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,200
Please come on in. Thanks for coming by.

340
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,800
Did I have a choice?

341
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,570
Of course you did.

342
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,470
I don't have anything to say,

343
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,850
so if you have a problem, contact my editors.

344
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,440
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

345
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,110
No, thank you.

346
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,280
Sure, sir, I'm gonna take some.

347
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,380
Great scoop, by the way.

348
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,150
If this doesn't make your career, God knows what will.

349
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,360
Holy moly.

350
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,000
That was something.

351
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,700
Well, I'm gonna be announced in a few days,

352
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,070
just as soon as all the paperwork goes through,

353
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,400
as the special counsel 

354
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,310
to investigate this leak about Erica Van Doren.

355
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,080
That was fast.        Yeah, I know, it's kind of unusual,

356
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,920
but the boys over at Justice seem to think 

357
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,590
this is a pretty urgent matter,

358
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,650
a not-a-second-to-Iose kind of thing.

359
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,290
So they called me in last night,

360
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,460
and I just checked into the hotel this morning, and here we are.

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,490
The Attorney General's office has to disqualify itself.

362
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,970
Maybe somebody over there was your source, eh?

363
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,870
I think I should call my lawyer.        That's not necessary.

364
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,910
I'm not gonna be asking you any questions.

365
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,010
Not here, anyway. This is neither the time nor the place.

366
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,340
I just wanted to get kind of an unofficial head start.

367
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,520
Can I talk to you off the record?

368
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,950
Sure.

369
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,760
I mean, a just-between-you-and-me kind of thing.

370
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,720
Off the record is off the record.

371
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,570
Okay, good. I'll do all the yada-yada.

372
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,730
Now, you were within your rights 

373
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,710
to print the information that you obtained.

374
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,510
However, you're not within your rights

375
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,070
to protect who it was 

376
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,950
that gave Erica up to you, who exposed her.

377
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,190
It's a 1982 law called 

378
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,710
the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.

379
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,280
Your source is in a great deal of trouble.

380
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,260
I've no intention of discussing my source...        Hold on.

381
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm doing the yada-yada, remember?

382
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,390
Okay.

383
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,600
Okay, look,

384
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,330
you're gonna be asked to appear before a grand jury.

385
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,390
You're gonna be asked to identify your source.

386
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,770
I'll be doing the asking.

387
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,670
Now, if, for some reason, you don't reveal your source,

388
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,610
you'll be held in contempt, and that means jail time,

389
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,840
and we're not talking about some sort of a Martha Stewart cell

390
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,910
with a butler, nonsense.

391
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,910
Look.

392
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,820
Rachel, go to your source.

393
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,490
Ask him to permit you to reveal his name.

394
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,060
You may be surprised at his willingness to protect you.

395
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,530
People are inherently decent, I have found.

396
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,570
Well, if that were true, 

397
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,610
that would put you out of a job, you know?

398
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,810
Well, that's all I've got to say. 

399
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,380
You'll be notified of your court date.

400
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm afraid I'm gonna disappoint you, Mr. Dubois.

401
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,260
That's not possible.

402
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,660
You ready? Here she is.        Here she is.

403
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,860
Ready to roll?

404
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,200
Rolling.

405
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,140
Hey, Erica, why do you think your report was ignored?

406
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,200
Is Erica your real name? How long have you been with the agency?

407
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,770
All right, I know you're trying to do your jobs, okay.

408
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,440
I'd love to speak to you. Now is not a good time.

409
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,080
I have an appointment here to read to the kids.

410
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,280
Is Erica your real name?

411
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,620
Did you give your husband top-secret information?

412
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,880
Does your family know that you're here?

413
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,820
You know, I'm a mom.

414
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,060
If this CIA report exists, 

415
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,820
as the Sun Times claims it does,

416
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,700
that would seem to indicate the President launched

417
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,530
a full-fledged act of war in Venezuela

418
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,590
without justification...        Thanks.

419
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,550
Really nice work.

420
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,270
...and just based on his own gut instinct.

421
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,670
It would also mean 

422
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,860
that either the President lied to the nation and the Congress...

423
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,770
Hey, Rache, they're waiting for you in Bonnie's office.

424
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,450
... what is arguably the worst foreign policy decision 

425
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,910
in this nation's history.

426
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,780
So far, the White House is standing by its actions,

427
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,950
but they're not denying the report.

428
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,780
Rachel.        Yeah, I'm going.

429
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,720
Kick-ass story, by the way.        Thank you.

430
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,490
... there's a reason to question the findings.

431
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,030
'W ait for me. Wait for me. I'm a fast runner,' said Ruthie.

432
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,890
'nd I'd sure like to catch something great,'

433
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,730
'she added, with a fishing pole in hand.

434
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,220
'So off they went. 

435
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,500
Up a hill, down a path, through a grove of trees,

436
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,320
'and just as Granny Annie was about to tell Ruthie 

437
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,940
what she was going to catch...'

438
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,090
If I'd been a little bit more forceful with you and Larry, 

439
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,640
saying don't rush this to press,

440
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,010
maybe we wouldn't be in this situation.

441
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,530
I told you, the government's gonna 

442
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,780
take this very seriously. I told...

443
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,840
The next time the FBI hauls you into a fucking interrogation,

444
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,930
your first goddamn phone call is to me!

445
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,820
I got it. I'm sorry.

446
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,260
Before you even take off your fucking seat belt, you call me!

447
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,290
All right, Avril.

448
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,500
You okay?

449
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,480
Yeah, I was dropping Timmy off at school,

450
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,230
 and the FBI were there,

451
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,640
and they asked me to go with them and...

452
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,540
Pretty unnerving, huh? Being questioned like that.

453
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,970
It was really fast.        They want your source, right?

454
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,040
Yeah. I didn't give it to them. I won't give it to them. No way.

455
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,150
Okay, please.

456
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,060
First of all, this is appalling behavior on the part of the FBI.

457
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,290
Snatching you in front of your kid. Strong-arming you.

458
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,700
I want to know the name of the agent that interviewed you.

459
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,800
Well, it wasn't an FBI agent. It was this guy Patton Dubois.

460
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,710
He's being appointed special prosecutor.

461
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,180
What? You know him?

462
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,700
No.

463
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,220
No. But a special prosecutor, that's no good.

464
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,120
See, his only requirement is to find your source,

465
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,680
with nothing else to divert him.

466
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,380
He's gonna have unlimited time, unlimited moolah,

467
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,950
and the chance of unlimited publicity.

468
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,700
There's a lot more investigative power 

469
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,720
for a special prosecutor than there is for a Fed.

470
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah, well, not enough power to make me reveal my source.

471
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,830
I have a right to protect my source.

472
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,130
What?        The federal government

473
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,470
doesn't have a shield law. Not on issues of national security.

474
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,040
49 states do have some form of protection for journalists,

475
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,290
but not the federal government.

476
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,480
The administration will back off

477
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,680
when they see how far we will go to protect Rachel.

478
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,780
The federal government is fighting for a principle, too.

479
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,090
You see, somebody revealed top secret information to you.

480
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,860
That is an act of treason. That is how they see it.

481
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,660
They're gonna take this very, very seriously.

482
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,960
Yeah, well, so am I, gonna take it very seriously.

483
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,470
Officer, what's the hold-up?        Sorry, ma'am.

484
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,200
Are you kidding? My house is right there.

485
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,070
She's on the list.         All right, go ahead.

486
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,080
I want a half-hour of reading every day.

487
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,520
You hear me?        Am I going to get into trouble

488
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,950
for not going to school?        No.

489
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,150
I'll miss my friends.        I know you will,

490
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,390
but it's just gonna be for a little while.

491
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,930
You're gonna have a private tutor. He's really great.

492
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,230
You'll love him. I promise. Kisses.

493
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,730
Bye-bye kiss, Eskimo kiss.

494
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,700
I love you.

495
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,070
I told you this would happen.

496
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,480
You just don't get it, do you?        This is your fault.

497
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,640
What do you want to listen to, baby?

498
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,700
Who's your best friend?

499
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,510
Who?        You!

500
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,350
Bye!

501
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,470
Are we off the record?

502
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,010
Sure. I'll meet you in the back.

503
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,380
You didn't come here to kick my ass, did you? 

504
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,420
'Cause it's not fair.

505
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm not trained in that whole,

506
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,830
'Knock somebody's nose into their brain '

507
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,360
'with the palm of my hand,' thing.

508
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,370
No, I use poison darts.

509
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,130
Funny.

510
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,470
I like your mums. The yellow ones are very cheerful.

511
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,940
Thank you.

512
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,280
Is your husband still writing?

513
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,680
Yeah, all the time. Every day.

514
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,180
I read his novel about the Mossad. 

515
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,550
I read it while I was on vacation. It was...

516
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,620
It was very entertaining.

517
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,830
Thank you. He's just trying to get out the second one.

518
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,600
So...

519
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,940
I'm sorry I lost my cool with you.

520
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,380
Usually it takes a man to bring out the heinous bitch in me.

521
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,980
Oscar and I...

522
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,090
It's probably it, you know, the dagger and all.

523
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,820
He's gone. He left.

524
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,990
We had it out, and he went to go stay with Allison

525
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,530
'cause we had to send her away, too.

526
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,660
Allison's a great kid.

527
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,970
She seems very grounded.

528
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,100
How do you know her? You been digging in her past, too?

529
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,970
No. No, I'm a room mother.

530
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,980
Room mother? Man. You should get hazard pay for that.

531
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,220
I come in once every two weeks to read to the kids. 

532
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,750
It's a big production.

533
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,810
Mom?        I love it.

534
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,260
I'm outside, Timmy!

535
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,620
What can I do for you?

536
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,680
I know you can't tell me who your source is. 

537
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,530
I respect that. Okay?

538
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,830
I know about keeping secrets.

539
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,860
Just tell me yes or no. All right? Is...

540
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,870
Is it someone close to me?

541
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,340
Is it?

542
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,010
Is it someone I work with?

543
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,950
I can't tell you anything.

544
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,050
You know what?

545
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,610
When you go before the grand jury, you will have to speak.

546
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,490
You are an unpatriotic little cunt...        Okay.

547
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,190
...who's gonna walk right off the plank into the bowels of hell.

548
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,490
Do you know that?        I hear that every day.

549
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,760
If you want to go on record, we'll give you amazing placement.

550
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,500
Thank you.

551
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,840
What?        Hi, Mrs. Van Doren.

552
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,340
Hello, handsome. How are you?

553
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,280
How's Allison doing? 

554
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,850
She hasn't been in school. Is she sick?

555
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,570
No, no, no. She is great. She's...

556
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,520
She's just spending time with a relative.

557
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,820
Can you tell her I said hi?        You bet. Yes, I will.

558
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,330
Is it the door?

559
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,380
Yeah?

560
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,040
Rachel Armstrong?        What do you need?

561
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,640
I'm here to serve you, ma'am.

562
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,980
I just barely had time to type that up and get over here.

563
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,050
Is it okay? Does it make sense to you?        Yeah.

564
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,420
I thought the law was supposed to move slowly?

565
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,220
Except for when it doesn't.

566
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,700
Hey, this is all bullshit, 

567
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,990
barging in on you in the middle of the night,

568
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,190
dragging you into the Mayflower, 

569
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,690
it's all just meant to intimidate you.

570
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,860
It's working.

571
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,670
Well, don't let it intimidate you. Okay?        Okay.

572
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,760
You're gonna be fine.

573
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,840
Miss Armstrong.

574
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,070
Okay, I'll be down in the lobby.

575
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,910
Okay.        Don't worry.

576
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,330
Rachel Alice Armstrong. 

577
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,040
15 Trinity Pass, Washington, D.C.

578
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,810
Thanks. Okay, Miss Armstrong.

579
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,780
You work as a reporter 

580
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,850
for the Capital Sun Times, is that correct?

581
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,020
Yes.

582
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,790
As the national political correspondent, is that right?

583
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,030
I am, yes. One of them.        Okay, good.

584
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,830
Okay, great. I'm batting a thousand.

585
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,530
You wrote an article a few days ago, here,

586
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,700
in which you revealed Erica Van Doren,

587
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,470
married to the former US ambassador, Oscar Van Doren,

588
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,310
that she was a covert CIA operative.

589
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,410
I did, yes.

590
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,250
And you feel confident with this story's veracity?

591
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,690
I do, 100%.

592
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,890
Who was your source?

593
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,230
Miss Armstrong...        One second. I'm sorry.

594
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,330
'I respectfully refuse to answer that question

595
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,030
'on the grounds that it would violate my rights

596
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,300
'under the First Amendment and federal common law.'

597
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,440
You're aware that anybody with official knowledge

598
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,040
of the identity of a CIA operative

599
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,420
is forbidden by law to release that information?

600
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,180
I am, yes.

601
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,750
So, who was your source?

602
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,450
I can't reveal my source...

603
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,650
Okay, look, Miss Armstrong.

604
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,550
This is a very serious matter.

605
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,860
I want you to take your time.

606
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,230
We're gonna take a recess and come back at, say, 1:30.

607
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,510
I want you to go home. I want you to talk to your family.

608
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,340
I want you to talk to your editor. Okay?

609
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,720
And then I want you to talk to your source.

610
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,690
Mull it over and see if you all think 

611
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,620
this is worth a contempt citation,

612
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,810
and then we're gonna reconvene,

613
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,450
and then I'm going to ask you again.

614
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,880
I wouldn't hold your breath.

615
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,330
Well, I'm not the one that'll need to hold my breath.

616
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,860
Okay, everybody,

617
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,170
we're gonna break it up. We'll come back at 1:30.

618
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,210
How long have you been in the CIA?        Ms. Van Doren...

619
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,510
'Can I come too?' asked Charlie.

620
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,520
'I promise to help you catch whatever it is,' he said.

621
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,820
'Come on,' said Ruthie Joe and Granny Annie.

622
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,620
'So off they went across the bridge...'

623
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,680
My watch says I'm early.

624
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,710
We just feel like 

625
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,370
this is not the best time for you to be with the kids.

626
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,330
It's just that,

627
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,380
you know, we're really not 

628
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,530
equipped to deal with a lot of craziness.

629
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,730
Okay.

630
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,000
I think it's idiotic, is what it is. 

631
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,580
I understand, the press can be a nightmare.

632
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,320
Maybe if you were to stay away for a while, 

633
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
then they would go away.

634
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,830
I hope we can work this out, Jerry. 

635
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,810
I really look forward to reading to the kids.

636
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,520
I mean, I'm pretty good at it, too. I do all the little voices.

637
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,520
You are. So...

638
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,050
When were you planning on bringing Ali back to school?

639
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,030
I don't know. I'm not sure.

640
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,530
I see. Okay.

641
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,540
Are you saying that she can't come back, Jerry?

642
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,240
How was your lunch?        Terrific. Thank you.

643
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,340
Yeah, what'd you have?        I actually didn't have anything.

644
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,640
Really?

645
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,410
I wish I had your will power.

646
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,580
Your source, Miss Armstrong, who is it?

647
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,690
Hey.

648
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,930
Well? How did it go?

649
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,820
Okay, I guess.

650
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,560
Excuse me. Rachel Armstrong?

651
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,230
Yes.        I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Jones.

652
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,390
I have a summons for you 

653
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,330
to appear in US District Court in two hours.

654
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,810
No, no, no.        What happened to two weeks?

655
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,040
Hey!

656
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,340
I'm Avril Aaronson,

657
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,470
counsel to the Capital Sun Times.        Oh, yeah,

658
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,980
I read your amicus brief on the Celeste matter last year.

659
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,210
I think you could take credit for her release. I really do.

660
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,950
I understand all the theatrics up until now, but this?

661
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,350
This is too fast. This is outrageous,

662
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,610
and we're getting into some pretty serious

663
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,150
 Fifth Amendment issues here.

664
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,070
Look, Avril, there's a traitor out there 

665
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,060
revealing the names of CIA operatives.

666
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,300
Now, I think we should 

667
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,800
get somebody like that out tout de suite. Don't you?

668
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,340
We're bringing in Albert Burnside.

669
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,880
I'll have to go home and get my autograph book, then.

670
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,600
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem. 

671
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,610
It's already in the Sun Times budget.

672
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,880
Hi, Avril.

673
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,310
Hey, there he is. Albert, thanks for coming. 

674
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,580
This is Rachel Armstrong.

675
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,780
Glad to meet you.        Hi, me, too.

676
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,870
Hey, I'm Ray, Rachel's husband.

677
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,120
Why is this happening so fast?

678
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,690
Avril said it'd be weeks until I went before a judge.

679
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,110
Well, Mr. Dubois wants to get this done 

680
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,820
before the press catches up.

681
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,670
It's okay. The press can just complicate things.

682
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,710
Let's concentrate on keeping you out of jail.

683
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,930
Jail? What do you... When?

684
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,570
You're gonna ask for a continuance?

685
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

686
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,070
Look, I've been through this. Judge Hall is a good egg.

687
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,050
We exchange Christmas cards.

688
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,410
He's certainly not gonna jail you today.

689
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,850
Jesus Christ.        Ray, relax.

690
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,820
I mean, if Albert's this calm, then we can be, too. Right?

691
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,980
We'll be out of here in five minutes.

692
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,210
Then we'll get a cup of joe 

693
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,650
and we'll strategize how we can protect you

694
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,760
and the constitution and democracy itself 

695
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,130
for generations to come.

696
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,030
That's a Theory, right?

697
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,370
Yeah.        It's classy.

698
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,530
Thanks. Nice suit.

699
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,740
It's not a suit. It's a Zegna. Hand stitched, 15 mil mil 15.

700
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,040
What's that you're wearing?

701
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,210
I don't know.

702
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,520
I'm putting you in touch with my tailor.

703
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,350
You always know when you're in a Zegna.

704
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,650
Court room three.

705
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,440
Your Honor, this morning, 

706
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,160
Miss Armstrong appeared before the grand jury.

707
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,860
I furnished you with the transcripts.

708
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,570
And as you know, she was asked 

709
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,630
to reveal the name of the source who provided her,

710
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,920
quite possibly illegally, 

711
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,700
with secret information revealing the...

712
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,070
Excuse me, Your Honor. If I may?

713
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,240
Yes.

714
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,670
All right?        It's perfectly okay with me.

715
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,080
Your Honor, I just met my client.

716
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,260
I ask you to continue this matter for, say, a week, 

717
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,780
so we can get our bearings here.

718
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,350
Let me get my bearings first. Why don't we proceed for now?

719
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,920
Well, here's how it is, Your Honor.

720
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,590
Mr. Dubois will say that my client was asked to 

721
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,960
name her source and that she won't do so,

722
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,830
 and, thus, you should compel her.

723
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,160
He'll say that the information 

724
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,170
that my client received is highly classified

725
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,850
and the GJ is entitled to know the name of the source 

726
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,700
and to find it out.

727
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,410
He'll also say that there's no federal shield law protecting her

728
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,570
and that there's no First Amendment protection, either,

729
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,520
because this is a matter of, quote-unquote, national security.

730
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,590
Is that about right, Mr. Dubois?

731
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,210
In fact, that's it in a nutshell.

732
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,120
We contend that the First Amendment 

733
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,890
does protect Rachel Armstrong.

734
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm well aware of cases in this circuit 

735
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,870
in which this contention is...

736
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,600
Well, I am aware of those cases in this circuit,

737
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,760
and they do not authorize her 

738
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,300
to refuse to respond to these questions.

739
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,670
Why don't the three of you come up here right now?

740
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,010
Rachel, Rachel, come on. Come on up.

741
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,080
Over here to where the bench is.

742
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,510
Miss Armstrong, I want you to understand

743
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,180
that if I should order you to reveal your source,

744
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,420
that if you don't do so, I'm gonna hold you in contempt of court

745
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,400
and that you will be jailed until you...

746
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,090
Hold on, Your Honor.

747
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,430
Can you rule, please, on my request for a continuance?

748
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,940
Right. I'm gonna deny that motion.

749
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,670
I'm only asking for a few days, Judge.

750
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,710
I understand. There is a serious national security...

751
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,240
There's no reason not to grant a continuance.

752
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,840
Let me run my courtroom.

753
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,920
Now, Miss Armstrong, 

754
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,910
I direct you to reveal the identity of your source.

755
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,560
If you want a few days to consider it, I'll give it to you.

756
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,160
I can't do that.

757
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,240
Mr. Burnside, if you want a few days 

758
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,690
to advise her to obey my order.

759
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,890
I can't advise my client to betray a confidence.

760
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,900
Okay, look, Your Honor,

761
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,940
given the direct threat to our national security,

762
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,880
I ask that Miss Armstrong now be held in contempt of court

763
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,470
and that she be jailed immediately.

764
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,990
Well, it seems to me that I have

765
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,210
 before me somebody who is defying my order

766
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,320
and who seems to believe that she is above the law itself.

767
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,160
I hold you in contempt of court,

768
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,430
and I remand you to the custody of the United States Marshal.

769
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,060
Help.        Judge...

770
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,930
Wait. No, no. Your Honor. Judge. Wait... No, wait.

771
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,870
Ma'am.        Your Honor!

772
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,430
As soon as you're prepared to speak, you will be released.

773
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,070
Could I have a minute with my client to confer?

774
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,970
You may consult with her in the detention center.

775
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,950
Timmy needs to be picked up from the Hobermans' at 5:30.

776
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,740
This proceeding is closed.        Judge.

777
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,580
Judge. Your Honor!

778
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,190
A lot of people looking to get famous here.

779
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,640
So now what? What do we do now?

780
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,790
I'll call you tomorrow. Don't worry about it.

781
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,730
What are you gonna do now?

782
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,050
I'm gonna call you in the morning.

783
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,760
All right? Okay?

784
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,320
Well, at least you'll take him off

785
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,270
 your Christmas card list. Right?

786
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,530
That's right.

787
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,260
It's a scare tactic.        You think?

788
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,800
I'll deal with it. I'll see you back at the paper.

789
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay, I'll head over there.

790
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,670
Mr. Burnside, this is a real honor for me.

791
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,340
I studied you, growing up. My dad was also a lawyer.

792
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,580
This is a big, big mistake, Patton.

793
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,420
Well, there's nothing like learning from our mistakes.

794
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,670
Yeah, well, sometimes a mistake 

795
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,120
is like wearing white after Labor Day,

796
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,650
and sometimes, a mistake is invading Russia in winter.

797
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,390
Okay, there are two things I need to know.

798
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,090
First, the story itself.        Rock solid.

799
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:33,070
Rock solid. Well, are we talking talc or are we talking granite?

800
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,070
Albert, please. We wouldn't have put it through

801
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,510
if it wasn't...        Okay. Second,

802
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,040
how many people know the...

803
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,770
How many people at the paper know the names of the sources?

804
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:45,010
We know the corroborating source. Well, Bonnie does, anyway,

805
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,330
and one of Rachel's sources at the FBI gave us 

806
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,880
a copy of Van Doren's report.

807
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,080
And why don't you have the name of the original source?

808
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,250
Well, for one thing, Rachel agreed to complete confidentiality,

809
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,800
and because her story was confirmed, 

810
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,260
it wasn't necessary to know.

811
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,730
Well, the good news is, you can't be compelled to testify

812
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,960
on something you don't know.

813
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,430
Bosca wallet.

814
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,470
Prada sunglasses.

815
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,430
You can keep that.        Thank you.

816
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,140
Tape recorder...

817
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,810
I'm gonna need to get your jewelry.

818
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,550
The wedding ring.

819
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,420
I'd like to hold on to those.

820
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,060
It's diamond, baby doll. You don't want that in there.

821
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,700
Miss Armstrong, come up front, please.

822
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,140
Take a stand in front of the machine, please.

823
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,080
Would you give me your right palm, please?

824
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,220
Take it off. Left, please.

825
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,850
It feels like his only real target is Rachel Armstrong

826
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,620
for publishing the article, which is not a crime. In fact...

827
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,370
Okay, if we've got Armstrong in jail, 

828
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,600
that's our biggest ace in the hole.

829
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,830
Two. The Van Dorens and everyone at the CIA

830
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,630
who worked with her have agreed to submit to polygraphs.

831
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,670
Jeez, could we turn this guy off?

832
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,730
 I can't listen to this anymore.

833
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,710
Better.

834
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,110
You know, that's the only thing 

835
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,050
that Armstrong's got going for her

836
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,150
is the media, getting them to turn her into 

837
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,310
some sort of a cause celeb.

838
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,080
We can't allow that to affect us.

839
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,320
Well, under the Branzburg case, they've got no chance on appeal.

840
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,460
Even if they point out that you didn't exhaust

841
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,760
any other possible sources before going to her.

842
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,390
Yeah. No, the Miller case made that perfectly clear.

843
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,260
Sit still for the camera.        But our objective,

844
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,770
our goal, is not to... Is not to keep her locked up.

845
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,370
I want to let her go.

846
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,380
That means we have got our source and we can prosecute him,

847
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,070
and, frankly, that's all I care about.

848
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,680
Sit as still as you can, looking straight ahead.

849
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,050
Answer with the word 'yes' or the word 'no.'

850
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,610
Is your name Erica Van Doren?

851
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,120
Yes.

852
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,990
Were you born in Ossining, New York?        Yes.

853
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,960
Have you ever lied on any official document?

854
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,090
No.

855
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,670
Did you reveal to Ms. Armstrong you were an employee of the CIA?

856
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,800
You gotta know a few rules.

857
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,080
First, ain't no smoking anywhere in the building.

858
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,250
Cigarettes are contraband.

859
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,260
No drugs, no fighting. Fighting just buys you time in deseg.

860
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,360
What's that?        Desegregation.

861
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,450
In the movies, they call it the hole.

862
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm taking you to the spillover room. 

863
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,160
We house the more violent girls in cells.

864
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,130
What are you, a doorman? Get out of here.

865
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,860
Come on. Let me out.        Get out of here. Get out.

866
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,610
And ain't no fucking.

867
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,080
No kind of sex at all. No eating pussy, no kissing, nothing.

868
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,520
If you're here for more than eight months, 

869
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,220
you can apply for a kite or a conjugal.

870
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,520
Here you go.

871
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,800
But the turnover here is normally two weeks. 

872
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,390
You won't even be here in eight months.

873
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,560
Hey!

874
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,590
Hey!

875
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,200
What's your name?        Olivia.

876
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,200
Olivia what?        Olivia James.

877
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,800
Well, Olivia James, this is Rachel...        Armstrong.

878
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,500
Rachel Armstrong, your new bunkie. Be nice.

879
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,670
And show her how to make the bed.

880
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,740
There you go.

881
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,120
Lights out in an hour. 

882
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,780
Lights up at 6:00 in the morning. All right?

883
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,050
Okay. Excuse me.

884
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,680
Is there any way of seeing a newspaper in the morning?

885
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,530
No. But if you wanna watch the news,

886
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,720
you have to convince all of them to do it.

887
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,830
On his birthday, who was driving...        He ain't no fool.

888
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,200
I don't care.        Ain't no tomming in the yard, you know.

889
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,970
That's just sad.

890
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,400
Are you one of those trained prevaricators, Erica?

891
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,200
You know, they teach you that at Langley? Box beater.

892
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,370
Kicked ass, didn't I?

893
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,180
Who do you think spoke to her? To Armstrong?

894
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,680
God damn it. I don't know!

895
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,880
But when you figure it out,

896
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,050
just give me five minutes with the prick, okay?

897
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,920
Well, it's been my experience that Miss Armstrong will tell us.

898
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,120
Right. She's never had her Vassar ass in jail. She'll break.

899
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,360
I don't know. I met her. I looked her in the eye.

900
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,870
She's a water-walker.

901
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,220
I wish we had the cookies, though.

902
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,460
Those were pretty good.

903
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,320
Hey. Hey.        Hey.

904
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,800
Guess who's here?

905
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,230
Little man wanted to say hey, make sure you're okay.

906
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,660
All right. Here he is.

907
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,260
Say hi.

908
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,930
Hey, baby. Hi.        Hi.

909
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,800
Hey. Why don't you tell Mommy what we brought her?

910
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,570
Mom.        Yeah.

911
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,740
We brought you some cookies, but they took them away.

912
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,750
No way.

913
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,380
Well, maybe they'll let me have them later for dessert.

914
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,860
Dad made them.        Dad made them? Yucky.

915
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,150
Hey,

916
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,030
I'm gonna be okay, sweetie.

917
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,430
Hey, how was your spelling test?

918
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,970
It was okay, I guess.

919
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,370
I bet you aced it.

920
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,600
Practiced really hard, didn't you? Didn't you?

921
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,410
Yeah.        You sure did.

922
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,280
Hand the phone to your dad, okay?

923
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,780
Hey.        Hey.

924
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,120
Hey. How are you?

925
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,050
I'm fine.        Yeah?

926
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,490
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't bring him anymore, Ray.

927
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,920
This is not a good place for him.

928
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,120
What are you talking about?

929
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,630
He's freaking out.

930
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,030
He wanted to see you. What do you mean? 

931
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,190
He wanted to make sure you were okay.

932
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,260
Well, of course he wanted to see me. But...

933
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,770
I mean, I'm really serious about this, Ray.        Okay.

934
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,870
I'm not gonna be here forever.

935
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,340
It's a couple of days. It's a few days.        Okay. Okay.

936
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:56,410
So what is going on in the news?

937
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,810
I haven't heard a thing.        You haven't?

938
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,550
No, there's no newspapers in here.

939
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,950
The TV is perpetually tuned into Jerry Springer.

940
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,620
Well, your jailing, your stance,

941
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,960
it's in every newspaper, on every channel.

942
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,920
No, no, no. I mean with the President. 

943
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,220
What have they said about the article?

944
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,990
No, same thing. Same as always.

945
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,500
'The White House refuses to comment on intelligence matters. '

946
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,300
What else are they going to say? Right?

947
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,590
I mean, the President, 

948
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,240
he's not making any press conferences, that's for sure.

949
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,200
Hey, listen, I was thinking...

950
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,280
I mean, if this gets crazy, crazier,

951
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,610
maybe you should tell me who it is.

952
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,660
And that way, I can maybe talk to the guy.

953
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,630
I don't know, like on a human level, you know?

954
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,130
Ray.        What?

955
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,930
I've never asked you, not once.

956
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:53,070
But this is... This is getting crazy.

957
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,770
Okay, let's not go there. At all.

958
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,840
You don't trust me?        That's not the point.

959
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,680
You don't trust me?

960
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,170
Is it... What is...        I guess that's it. It's over.

961
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,520
Okay. I miss you.

962
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,090
I miss you, too. Can you pass the phone back to...

963
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,190
Hey, can you hear me?        Yeah.

964
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,030
Okay. I need you to make your bed in the morning. All right?

965
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,540
I need at least one responsible male in the house.

966
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,270
Okay? Don't tell Daddy I said that, okay?

967
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,600
I'll...

968
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:39,540
She can't hear you, buddy. Okay? She'll come home soon. Come on.

969
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,800
All rise. Hear ye, hear ye.

970
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,630
Armstrong. Let's go.        All persons having business

971
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,920
with the United States District Court 

972
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,000
in the District of Columbia will draw near.

973
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,600
Give your attention and you shall be heard.

974
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,790
Mr. Burnside, your client is here now, 

975
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,990
so you may proceed when you're ready.

976
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,620
Thank you, sir.

977
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,890
Your Honor, I would ask that you would release Ms. Armstrong

978
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,560
until such time as the U.S. Court of Appeals can rule

979
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,860
on the validity of this contempt citation.

980
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,400
Now that would vitiate the whole purpose

981
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,230
of her incarceration in the first place.

982
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,100
She has the key to her own cell.

983
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,510
A key that comes in the form of a loss of integrity 

984
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,510
is no key at all.

985
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,310
Integrity is subjective.

986
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,510
Miss Armstrong, I'm sympathetic, but you've gotta help me out.

987
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,020
Will you represent to me that if you're home

988
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:52,390
that you'll pick up the phone and call or contact your source

989
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,090
and try to get permission for you to release the source's name

990
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,560
so we can put an end to all of this?

991
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,500
I would be dishonest if I said I could do that.

992
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,900
Well, then, you're really not giving me any basis at all.

993
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:05,130
The motion is denied.

994
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,930
Sir, I would ask that the court now

995
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:13,380
impose a fine of $10,000 a day against the Sun Times

996
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,840
until such time as Miss Armstrong's source be revealed.

997
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,180
Your Honor,

998
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,280
with all due respect to you, this court and Miss Armstrong,

999
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,940
we don't know who her source is.

1000
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,650
I don't see how we could be held accountable.

1001
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,120
Sir, obviously, with the representation on display here,

1002
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,290
obviously, the paper not only supports,

1003
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,330
but is encouraging Miss Armstrong's position.

1004
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:35,770
They're enabling her.

1005
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,030
The Sun Times should be obliged to obey Your Honor,

1006
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,370
and dismiss Miss Armstrong if she does not.

1007
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,240
That is out of line!

1008
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,100
Your Honor, respectfully, I ask you to deny this motion.

1009
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,220
Don't even think of buckling. Don't even think it.

1010
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,830
You pay the fine,

1011
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,550
and you let Rachel hold strong, 

1012
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,070
exactly the way she's been doing.

1013
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,600
You didn't need to say that.

1014
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,030
Such a beautiful day.

1015
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,220
I like coming here.        Yeah.

1016
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,190
It reminds me why we do what we do.

1017
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,330
I agree.

1018
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,460
You know, my daddy is buried right over there.

1019
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,030
I feel it best that we not meet at Langley

1020
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,940
for the time being.        Yeah. Okay.

1021
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,200
Yeah. You know, I'm just glad that you asked to see me.

1022
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,270
I've been wanting to speak to you since this all broke.

1023
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,870
You know, I was hoping I'd convince you

1024
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,480
to give me a crack at the CBD in the Balkans.

1025
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,810
There's other business to attend to first.        Okay.

1026
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,880
Erica, we've investigated to the fullest degree

1027
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,760
all of those people who were aware of your cover.

1028
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,990
We've looked at phone records, emails, the works.

1029
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,690
We're dead ending here.        Really?

1030
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:17,460
So far, the reporter is in jail and not talking.

1031
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,990
It's essential we find out where this leak came from.

1032
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,690
I know. I understand. You know, 

1033
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,730
and I couldn't agree with you more.

1034
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,540
You know, we don't know if this person had it in for you 

1035
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,680
or had it in for the agency,

1036
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,270
so can I just pick your brain a little bit?

1037
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,480
Yeah, of course. Please. I completely understand.

1038
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:33,800
Ask me whatever you want.

1039
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,110
When did you first meet Rachel Armstrong?

1040
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,850
Knowingly? When she came to me at the soccer game,

1041
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,550
when she confronted me.

1042
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,900
And you're both volunteers 

1043
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,320
at Potomac Shores Elementary School, right?

1044
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,890
I am. Well, no, I'm not. I was, but I'm not now,

1045
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,630
but she was a room mother there, she said.

1046
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,830
You never met at school functions before that?

1047
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,470
No.        Your volunteer work never overlapped?

1048
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,270
You guys never perhaps talked mom to mom?

1049
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,680
No. No.

1050
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,510
Ever go to a school event where alcohol was being served?

1051
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,250
What? What?

1052
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,920
You know, when my wife went to those functions,

1053
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,960
those let-your-hair-down things,

1054
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,000
my God, I can't tell you the things she said 

1055
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,460
that she now wishes she could take back.

1056
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,160
Sir, wait.

1057
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,570
Are you still investigating me?

1058
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,030
Well...        I just passed a polygraph.

1059
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,500
Well, given your training, I'm not sure how valuable that is.

1060
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,270
It is a clinical investigation. 

1061
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,840
You don't need to take it personally.

1062
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,440
I don't need to take it personally?

1063
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,780
'We think that you're either incompetent, a drunk, or a liar,

1064
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,680
'but you don't need to take it personally.'

1065
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,110
How dare you?

1066
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,290
How fucking dare you?        Okay,

1067
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,100
you need to watch your tone here, Erica.

1068
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,190
Let me ask you a question, sir.

1069
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,340
What, in my absolutely unblemished record, 

1070
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,700
can you point to and say,

1071
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,560
'Yeah, yeah, that's somebody we can't trust'?

1072
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,730
What?        Point is, I don't even know you.

1073
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,240
You've been a NOC for so many years,

1074
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,210
there are very few people who actually know you.

1075
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,800
Okay, well, you know what? I know you. I know you, sir.

1076
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,610
I know your type. I see where this is going. I smell it.

1077
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,380
You know, if somebody in the CIA messed up,

1078
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,080
somebody messed up, gave me up

1079
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,130
and now you guys are walking around investigating it 

1080
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,490
like the Keystone Kops.

1081
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,530
You're just aching for it to be me. I see it.

1082
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,810
This way you can tell the press, 

1083
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,890
'You know what? It's not a rogue agent.

1084
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,090
'It is just some silly little girl whose feelings got hurt

1085
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,070
'that her investigative conclusions were ignored

1086
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,630
'by the President of the United States.'

1087
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,900
Findings that absolved Venezuela

1088
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,250
from having anything at all to do 

1089
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,960
with the assassination attempt on him.

1090
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,440
Now you're being dramatic, Erica.        Fine, okay.

1091
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,640
You know what? You can speak to my attorney from now on.

1092
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,380
You can drop my protective detail.

1093
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,150
You can stop cutting me checks. Okay? I quit.

1094
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,690
You don't just quit, Erica.

1095
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,160
Really? What is this, The Sopranos? 

1096
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,690
I can't leave the family? I'm stuck?

1097
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,060
Well, it's a process. You're full of privileged information.

1098
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,430
You don't trust me? Fine, okay.

1099
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,530
I'm gonna give you reason not to. Okay?

1100
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,330
My husband's not the only one in the family who can write.

1101
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,580
Look, you sure you want to 

1102
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,500
get in a war with the government, Erica?

1103
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,130
Do you need the messiness?

1104
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,700
You're in the middle of a custody battle, right?

1105
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,770
You sure you want to drag Allison into the middle of all this?

1106
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,980
You are so lucky you are a woman.

1107
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,180
Why is that?

1108
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,480
Because I don't hit girls.

1109
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,460
You know, you weren't the only agent 

1110
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,390
investigating the Venezuelans,

1111
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,920
but you were the only one that concluded

1112
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,490
that they were not involved in the attack on the President.

1113
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,690
Yours is not the only report the President read.

1114
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,020
I wish you the very best of luck 

1115
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,130
with your daughter and the custody battle.

1116
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,840
I hope you get to see her again.

1117
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,080
Thank you.

1118
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,040
Yeah, watch this.

1119
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,760
If there was enough money in the world, 

1120
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,650
I'd be buying my way out of this.

1121
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,370
Honey, if there was enough money in the world, 

1122
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,120
I wouldn't be in here in the first place.

1123
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,720
You got that right.

1124
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,460
What's that?

1125
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,400
A Christmas present from my son.

1126
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,700
How old is he?        Seven.

1127
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:48,970
Shit, ain't nobody in the whole world seven years old no more.

1128
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,230
I'm moving in.

1129
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,040
That fat piece of shit over there keeps farting all night.

1130
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,310
About to turn my carjacking beef into a homicide 

1131
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,880
if I stay over there.

1132
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,420
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

1133
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,800
Congratulations, everyone. 

1134
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,660
We have three Pulitzer finalists in our midst.

1135
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,290
For investigative reporting.

1136
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,760
Yo, Armstrong.

1137
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,740
A message for you from somebody named Bunny.

1138
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,000
I just took it for you. We couldn't find you upstairs.

1139
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,490
So you won something, huh?

1140
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,650
I ain't never won nothing.

1141
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,550
Thanks.        Sure.

1142
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,820
How was school today?

1143
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,730
Okay, I guess.        Yeah?

1144
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,590
What was the best part?        I don't know.

1145
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,770
Hey, I won an award. Though I almost did.

1146
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,970
A big one, for being a good reporter.

1147
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,670
That's nice.        And the first person I wanted to tell

1148
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:05,680
was you 'cause you're my most special guy.

1149
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,720
You want to put your dad back on?        Okay.

1150
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,190
Okay.

1151
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,360
Hey, he really misses you.

1152
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,090
Really?        So, the Pulitzer?

1153
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:29,330
Yeah. You told me, remember?

1154
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,340
That's not that...

1155
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,740
Everyone to your bunk! Shake down!

1156
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,350
Lock your hands behind your head.

1157
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,480
Come on, Armstrong, let's get to your bunk.

1158
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,180
Lock your hands behind your head. Shake down!

1159
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,160
Let's go!        Let's go, ladies!

1160
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,020
I can find your head by your bunks.

1161
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,890
Move!        Let's go, ladies! Let's go!

1162
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,090
Get to your racks now!

1163
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,870
What is you doing, Miss Jones? Get to your bunk, now!

1164
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,280
You know this is not allowed in here. It's contraband.

1165
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,540
Sorry.

1166
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,150
You been taking these from the IK for weeks.

1167
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,980
More contraband.

1168
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,670
Hey, that's personal stuff.

1169
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,080
Can I have that back? 

1170
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,800
What the fuck is this? You can't take that!

1171
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,840
What did you say?        She can't take that. It's mine!

1172
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,380
Get back to your bunk!

1173
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:44,970
You hold that noise, ma'am, or I will take you to the hole!

1174
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,740
You understand me?

1175
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,990
Lock your hands behind your head.

1176
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,990
Deseg for you.

1177
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,820
Fuck.

1178
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:27,150
Well, it's amazing news about the Pulitzer. Congratulations.

1179
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,490
Yeah. No, that's great. I just...

1180
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,530
I'm not surprised Tom Williams got it.

1181
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,500
His story got the mayor to resign.

1182
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,580
The President is so popular, 

1183
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,860
nobody gave a damn about what I wrote.

1184
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,200
Well, we're all proud of you.

1185
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,300
No, I know. Thanks.

1186
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,330
I'm sorry.

1187
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,120
They took my journal, my notes, 

1188
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,040
for taking an apple out of the chow house.

1189
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,310
I can't write, and it's driving me nuts.

1190
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,010
They took my pen. I can't even write to Timmy anymore.

1191
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,780
I was wondering if you could possibly

1192
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,050
write an editorial or something, shame them a bit.

1193
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,680
Yeah, of course. Tomorrow, tomorrow's paper.

1194
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,120
Thank you.

1195
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,250
So, look,

1196
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,850
Molly Meyers wants to interview you.

1197
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,290
What? Why? I'm not anorexic.

1198
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:13,030
I'm not in rehab. I'm not dating Justin Timberlake.

1199
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,800
Human interest, I guess.

1200
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,210
Look, she's a journalist. She has to be on your side, right?

1201
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,010
The top dogs are really pushing for it.

1202
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,340
It's like you said, no one's writing about your case anymore.

1203
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,380
We're losing traction.

1204
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:28,780
The government isn't feeling the public pressure.

1205
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,220
And the fines and the legal fees are growing.

1206
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,610
I get it. Say hi to Avril...

1207
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,810
Don't think about that. No. No, no.

1208
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,110
We just need to get you out in front again, 

1209
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,160
and, for what it's worth,

1210
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,550
Molly Meyers will get the eyeballs on you.

1211
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,730
So?

1212
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,670
Okay. But it's gotta be live.

1213
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,600
She's not gonna edit me into a doddering idiot.

1214
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:52,040
Absolutely.        And I'm not fucking crying, either.

1215
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,200
All right.

1216
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,740
What are you wearing? What is this, the new Cartier?

1217
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,210
It's a wonderful watch.

1218
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,620
No, it's not a watch. It's jewelry. Here, look at here.

1219
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,650
I'm suddenly nuts about this de Grisogono. I love the numerals.

1220
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,190
All different sizes. Isn't that nice?        It's a beauty.

1221
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,020
Ready, Molly.        All right, have fun.

1222
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:18,030
Okay. They're telling me it's gonna be substantive.

1223
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,590
It's gonna be serious.

1224
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,800
Really?        Well, that's what they're telling me.

1225
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:25,780
This will be your moment, not hers. You'll be great.

1226
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,730
Here you go.

1227
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,940
Rachel, hi. I'm Molly Meyers.

1228
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,080
Right, we met once.

1229
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,540
I interviewed with you to be your research assistant.

1230
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,280
Oh, no kidding.

1231
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,380
We are not going to have time for this.

1232
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,150
If you have time for the Identities Act.

1233
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,360
Great. If not, so be it.

1234
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,290
That's fine.        One minute.

1235
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,490
All right. Thank you so much for doing this, Rachel.

1236
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,410
And congratulations on the Pulitzer.

1237
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,290
It was just a finalist.

1238
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,860
Well, bravo. We're all with you.

1239
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,360
Thank you, that's very nice.

1240
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,810
Of course, I can't say it on the air. Objectivity and all that.

1241
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,240
All right, ready?

1242
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,270
You know we're live?

1243
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:04,180
Todd is gonna toss it to you in three, two...

1244
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,810
Thank you, Todd.

1245
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,220
Rachel Armstrong, thank you for joining us.

1246
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,450
Rachel, you have been here for seven months.

1247
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,990
How are you feeling?

1248
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,260
Well, physically I feel fine.

1249
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,730
I don't get the exercise that I need, but I feel fine.

1250
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,630
You know, I look at you and I get this sort of, 

1251
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,000
"How do you do it?" sensation.

1252
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:34,200
Vassar girl, Columbia Journalism, suburban soccer mom...

1253
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,880
How Twilight Zoneish is this for you?

1254
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,940
I must say, when I wake up in the morning,

1255
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,280
it does take me a few seconds to realize where I am.

1256
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:45,910
I mean, I haven't grown accustomed to it.

1257
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,660
You're married to the novelist, Ray Armstrong.

1258
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,190
How is the marriage holding up?

1259
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,530
Well, obviously, it puts pressure...

1260
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:57,630
It must be very hard.

1261
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,690
It is hard. But we're strong.

1262
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:05,150
You know, he's very supportive of me, and we're best friends.

1263
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,550
That really helps.

1264
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,580
And what about your son? Timothy.

1265
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,540
When was the last time you saw him?

1266
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,220
It's been a long time.

1267
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,090
How long?

1268
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,320
He came to see me when I was first brought here,

1269
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,900
but I have asked that he not visit me in this place.

1270
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,600
Well, that must be brutal.

1271
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,050
Most mothers, though, 

1272
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:40,870
are going to have a hard time understanding.

1273
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:43,040
I guess I would have, too,

1274
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,510
but most mothers would have no idea what they would do

1275
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,280
unless they were in my position.

1276
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:56,120
The truth is, bringing Timmy here would be selfish.

1277
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,590
You know, it would be for me.

1278
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,580
And I do wonder a lot 

1279
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:07,960
if I can survive another day not seeing him,

1280
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,840
but I know Timmy,

1281
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:16,650
and I saw the look in his eyes when he was brought here,

1282
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:22,040
and I know the damage that it would do

1283
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,060
to see his mother in this place, caged up.

1284
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,560
So, you know, I can't do that to him.

1285
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:35,130
Rachel, let's get to the meat of it, because I have to try.

1286
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,370
On your story, on uncovering 

1287
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:41,370
the identity of the CIA agent Erica Van Doren,

1288
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,370
who was your source?

1289
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:48,500
Well, Molly, let me ask you. Why do you have to try?

1290
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,810
Try to get a fellow journalist to betray her integrity?

1291
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,250
I know you know better than that. I know you do.

1292
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,380
Before the cameras rolled, 

1293
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,380
you said you were, quote-unquote, with me.

1294
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,960
Look, I have empathy. 

1295
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,290
Like you, I would never give up a source.

1296
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,520
But you know what? Sometimes sources have motives.

1297
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,860
Right, okay.

1298
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,130
If the information they're giving is valuable and truthful,

1299
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,220
like with Watergate or the Pentagon Papers, 

1300
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,660
then their motives really don't matter.

1301
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,940
Any real journalist would be prepared to 

1302
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,260
put up with the discomfort of jail

1303
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,970
to protect their principle.

1304
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,710
I know you say you would protect your source,

1305
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:25,180
as if you're saying, "There but for the grace of God go I,"

1306
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,210
and you're never gonna have to worry about

1307
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:31,410
the government coming after you.        Why?

1308
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,650
Because the government really doesn't care

1309
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,890
how you found out where Paris had dinner last night.

1310
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:41,760
That's my bunkie right there, y'all. That's my bunkie!

1311
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:04,980
Ray.

1312
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,990
Hey. Hey, Albert. Hey.

1313
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,590
Hi, I'm Albert Burnside.

1314
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,130
Hi, I'm Gretchen Monroy.        Hi.

1315
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,790
So, did you see the Molly Meyers thing?        Yes. Yes.

1316
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:20,140
Rachel was real terrific. It was great.

1317
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,740
Yeah, she was unbelievable.

1318
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,940
I'll catch up with you.        Sure.

1319
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,040
Nice to meet you.

1320
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,280
Look, Albert.        It's none of my business.

1321
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,680
No, no, no. No, you don't.

1322
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,720
There are things about us that you just don't...

1323
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:41,420
When you say "us"?        Rachel and me.

1324
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,820
Look, Ray, if you can sleep at night, you can sleep at night.

1325
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,930
She made a choice.

1326
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,660
Choices have consequences.        Yeah, if you think your wife

1327
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,030
felt like she had a choice in this, 

1328
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:00,600
then maybe you two shouldn't be together.

1329
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:06,710
Well, you can tell her or not. That's entirely up to you.

1330
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,920
Keep up the good work.

1331
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,570
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me. Didn't mean to startle you.

1332
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,240
That's okay.        I'm looking for the Stein residence.

1333
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,940
Stein residence?

1334
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,080
You know, I don't know. 

1335
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,920
I don't think there is a Stein on the block.

1336
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,820
Harv and Sheila?

1337
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,920
Harv and Sheila...

1338
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,730
Oh, God.

1339
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,810
Rachel?

1340
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:28,960
Who do you have working the story?

1341
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,500
Evans and Merkow.

1342
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:34,440
The shooter belonged to a right wing fringe group.

1343
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,170
I guess he thought Erica had it in for our beloved President.

1344
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:42,270
Name's Alan Murphy. He's nuts and stupid.

1345
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,090
Drove his own car to the murder site, 

1346
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,940
then crashed it half a mile away.

1347
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:51,450
Once she resigned from the CIA, she lost her protective detail.

1348
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,390
God, this is so crazy.

1349
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,470
Evans and Merkow will want to 

1350
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,290
get a statement from you of some kind.

1351
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:07,500
I know. I get it. It's okay.

1352
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,640
It's okay.

1353
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,840
How's Allison doing?        Who is Allison?

1354
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,640
Erica's daughter.

1355
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,180
Bonnie...        It is not your fault.

1356
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,290
Am I doing the right thing?

1357
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:37,460
What's the problem? We still have 15 minutes.

1358
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,570
Judge wants to see her. I've got a van waiting.

1359
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,340
The President now seems to 

1360
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,560
feel compelled to get involved personally.

1361
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,890
He wants to get to the bottom of this debacle.

1362
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,270
What happened is terrible, 

1363
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,660
and my heart goes out to her little girl,

1364
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,320
but it hasn't changed my position.

1365
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,540
Okay, that's not what I need.

1366
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,910
I have here copies of waivers

1367
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:27,480
that have been signed by all White House staff and senior CIA.

1368
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,520
It authorizes you, gives you permission

1369
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:35,180
to reveal their names if they were your source.

1370
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,560
It's a blanket waiver.

1371
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,920
That should do it for you.

1372
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,490
Have a look. See if your source has signed.

1373
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,900
These people were obviously coerced.        These people here?

1374
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,340
These people have signed of their own volition.

1375
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:54,340
Yeah, if you don't sign these, then we'll harass you,

1376
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:58,140
we'll investigate you, we'll make your life hell on earth.

1377
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,420
I'm not even going to look at them, Judge.

1378
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,790
Anybody want some tea?        Yes, please.

1379
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,160
No, thank you.        It's from Greece.

1380
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,930
What are we going to do with you?

1381
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,350
This has gotten to the point now 

1382
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:29,780
where my wife is pissed off at me

1383
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,210
and is telling me that I'm some sort of bully.

1384
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,320
Well, you're not gonna get much sympathy from me there.

1385
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:41,350
Your Honor, can I borrow your library for a second?

1386
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,530
You think I should look at the waivers.

1387
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:02,710
A man can live a good life, be honorable, give to charity,

1388
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,070
but in the end, the number of people who come to his funeral

1389
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,810
is generally dependent on the weather.

1390
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,160
What? I'm sorry. I'm not following.

1391
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,050
The weather has changed, Rachel. 

1392
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:23,340
I'm sorry, but it has. That's the truth. 

1393
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,270
In the old days, this would have been a lot easier to fight.

1394
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,170
The public would have called you a hero.

1395
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,800
But I don't know, somewhere along the line, the press...

1396
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,290
The press stopped being the white knight, 

1397
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:37,780
and started being the dragon.

1398
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:39,480
That's the way people see it.

1399
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,920
You want to know why no paper in this country, 

1400
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,820
including your own,

1401
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,120
has continued covering your story?

1402
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,920
Why don't you tell me?

1403
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:54,360
Because your 48-hour news cycle dried up months ago.

1404
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,360
I mean, look at you, Rachel. You look like shit.

1405
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,970
Your kid is growing up without you...

1406
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,670
Don't bring Timmy into this.

1407
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,350
It's not fair. Okay. I'm a good mother.

1408
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,970
Fair? Fuck fair!

1409
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,200
Look, you may not want to bring your son into this,

1410
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,540
but I do. You want to know why?        Why?

1411
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:13,520
Because I'm defending Rachel Armstrong, not a principle.

1412
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:22,330
A man leaves his family to go to jail

1413
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:24,020
 to protect a principle,

1414
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,930
and they name a holiday after him.

1415
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,020
A man leaves his children to go fight in a war,

1416
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,530
and they erect a monument to him.

1417
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,200
A woman does the same thing, and she's the monster.

1418
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,610
If we back down, what are we saying, Albert?

1419
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,500
"Trust reporters as long as they're not mothers, "

1420
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,080
"because they'll crack."

1421
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:48,780
The truth is, if I had known that writing this fucking story

1422
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,180
would have separated me from Timmy,

1423
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,750
then maybe I wouldn't have done it.

1424
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,920
But here we are. The story's been published,

1425
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:59,430
and the path has been chosen, and there's no way back,

1426
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,950
and in the end, my son will be fine.

1427
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:06,730
You know, Ray is a great father, and Timmy's gonna be okay,

1428
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:11,170
but that will not be the case with my source.

1429
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,030
My source will be publicly saddled 

1430
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,840
with the death of Erica Van Doren,

1431
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,070
and that, I promise you,

1432
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:19,240
will mean the destruction of the person we're talking about,

1433
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,810
and that, Albert, that is not fair.

1434
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,180
Why?

1435
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:29,070
I mean, your source knew full well 

1436
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,120
the ramifications of speaking to you.

1437
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,890
My source didn't know what they were doing

1438
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:41,160
when I got the information.

1439
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:46,580
Was he drunk? Was he talking in his sleep?

1440
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,930
Hey, take a fucking walk.

1441
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,410
We're trying to swim a fucking waterfall here, Albert.

1442
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,920
We have a responsibility to the shareholders not to go bankrupt.

1443
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,120
If you're so worried about that, 

1444
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,880
then I'll go pro bono from here on in.

1445
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,580
How about that?        Sold.

1446
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,660
Come in.

1447
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:06,220
Okay. I just got off the phone.

1448
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,370
Stan Riggens has agreed to speak to the grand jury.

1449
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,630
I guess signing that waiver spooked him.

1450
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,800
Stan?

1451
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,680
I owe that kid in my office 10 bucks.

1452
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,200
When is all this supposed to happen?

1453
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,940
As soon as possible. It'll have to wait until tomorrow morning.

1454
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,140
Once he confirms he was your source, you're off the hook.

1455
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,280
Pack your bags, Rachel.

1456
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,880
You were chief of staff to the Vice President.

1457
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,550
I resigned 11 months ago.

1458
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:43,190
And were you the source of information provided

1459
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:47,260
on the October 6th edition of the Capital Sun Times

1460
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:51,900
in which the identity of the covert CIA agent was revealed?

1461
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,440
I was.

1462
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,450
Can you tell us all how that came about?

1463
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,290
Well, I guess I was just so angry 

1464
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,840
at Erica Van Doren and her husband,

1465
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,630
my emotions got the better of me.

1466
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,290
I'm not interested in your motivations.

1467
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,990
I want to know how you came to reveal this information.

1468
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:15,760
I was at a party.

1469
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:16,860
...you guys, it's muddy right here.

1470
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,700
I had been drinking.

1471
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,130
Stan.

1472
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,540
Hello there, young-ish lady. How are you?

1473
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:33,670
Can I get a beer, please? Good. Great. Just here with my son.

1474
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:37,910
They're cute now, but they grow up. You know?

1475
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,050
So I've been reading.

1476
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,890
So I heard Glen invited you. It's good to see you.

1477
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,510
Yeah, and you thought, 

1478
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,160
"Well, how can I pass up this opportunity?"

1479
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,720
That is exactly what I thought.

1480
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,310
Can I ask you a question?        Anything.

1481
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:57,640
Ambassador Van Doren.

1482
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,840
What about him?        His wife.

1483
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,940
Is she a spook, Stan?

1484
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,580
Come here.

1485
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,050
Now, look, you did not hear this from me.        Of course not.

1486
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:18,030
Not from me.        Absolutely not.

1487
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:22,330
But, everybody knows she's at the CIA. Everybody.

1488
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,730
But you can't use that.

1489
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,790
Hey, I won't say it came from you, but we're not off the record.

1490
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,500
Screw it.

1491
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,340
Everybody knows anyway. Common knowledge.

1492
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,110
Do you know if she happened to get out to Venezuela at all?

1493
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,670
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1494
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,080
She came to you and asked you if Ms. Van Doren was a spy?

1495
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,090
She already knew.

1496
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,020
That's right.

1497
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,360
They're not satisfied with Riggens.

1498
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,630
He was just your corroborative source.

1499
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,400
So was the FBI guy who gave you her report.

1500
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,880
They still want the original source, 

1501
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,900
which puts us back at square one.

1502
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:07,440
Well, how much longer can this go on?

1503
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,240
It's seven months or so 

1504
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,180
before the grand jury is required to disband,

1505
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,720
and then Dubois can just order up a new one.

1506
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,120
I can't...

1507
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:32,960
I'm gonna have to tell the Warden I did this.

1508
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,870
Look,

1509
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:44,440
if you're gonna be here another seven months,

1510
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:48,140
then you should know, in every way

1511
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,390
how this will affect you.

1512
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,020
Albert told me.

1513
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,170
Well, do I get any details?

1514
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,800
Details? Yeah.

1515
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,870
The details are you're in here,

1516
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:28,580
and whatever it is keeping you in here

1517
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:32,050
is more important to you than what's on the outside.

1518
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:36,970
Well, how long have you been seeing her?

1519
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,120
Just a few weeks.

1520
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,930
Do you love her?        I don't know.

1521
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,490
You don't know?

1522
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:47,770
It's only been a few weeks. You don't know her.

1523
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,570
What do you do with Timmy?        What?

1524
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,340
When you're fucking her, what do you do with Timmy?

1525
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:58,540
He's with a sitter when we go out.

1526
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,240
Has he met her?        No.

1527
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,810
Do I know her?        You don't know her. I told you that.

1528
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:07,150
She lives in Maryland...        Okay. You know what,

1529
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,420
I don't want to hear any more.        Look...

1530
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:13,430
Ray, I know this is impossible for all of us.

1531
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:16,320
I get it. You're Ionely. I'm Ionely.

1532
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,070
Look, all you have to do to keep me,

1533
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:24,230
to keep my respect, is just tell me it means nothing.

1534
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:28,270
That you love me, and that...

1535
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,130
I'd like to see Timmy now.

1536
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,620
Something you should know is 

1537
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,790
I speak only the best about you to him.

1538
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,880
All right, don't patronize me. Okay?

1539
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,030
I need to see him, and he needs to see me.

1540
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:57,900
That's it.        Okay. Okay.

1541
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:59,810
I'll see what we can do.

1542
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,340
They don't allow visitation on weekends anymore,

1543
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:05,940
and his school routine is pretty locked in.

1544
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,550
So, now, on top of everything else,

1545
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,020
you're gonna try and keep my son from me?

1546
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,950
No. No, it's not like that.        Isn't like what, Ray?

1547
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,460
It's not like you're cheating on your wife

1548
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,450
while she is fucking rotting in jail?

1549
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:15,350
Keep your voice down.

1550
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,020
Rache.        Is that what it's not like?

1551
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,420
Fuck you!        Hey! Hey!

1552
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,330
Fuck off!        Okay, okay, okay.

1553
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,670
Go to hell!

1554
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,200
It's okay.

1555
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,600
Really, this is how you want...

1556
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,410
You know what? Thanks for the fuck, Ray! 

1557
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,880
That really hit the spot!

1558
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,900
Right, 'cause you're the only one 

1559
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,950
who got fucked by all this. Right?

1560
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,870
Hey.

1561
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:06,000
What the fuck is your problem?

1562
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,670
You're in my bunk.        Get a new fucking bunk.

1563
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,940
Hey. That's my stuff! Stop it!

1564
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:14,910
Yeah. It's going down here!

1565
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,050
Hey!        Get your skanky ass stuff out of my bunk!

1566
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:21,490
Go get a new bunk!        Get your ass out of my fucking bunk.

1567
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,580
This is not your bunk!

1568
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:24,790
That ain't right.

1569
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,460
You want the bunk? Your bunk? You want that bunk? Huh?

1570
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,900
You want that bunk?

1571
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,940
You want your fucking bunk now, huh?

1572
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:45,180
Yeah.

1573
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,520
Come on, leave her alone.

1574
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,120
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1575
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,400
Oh, God.

1576
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,000
What happened?

1577
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:23,590
I got the shit kicked out of me, Albert. That's what happened.

1578
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:25,450
How? What? Over what?

1579
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,850
We both wanted the top bunk.        What?

1580
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:35,260
Well, you've always known the important things to fight for.

1581
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:43,300
Are the doctors saying you're gonna be all right?

1582
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,400
Yeah. Whatever that means.

1583
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:57,420
You know, I'm the most senior prisoner in this jail.

1584
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,720
I've had 32 different bunk mates since I've been here.

1585
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:05,530
I gotta say, that's a record.

1586
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,730
Is that a new tie?

1587
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:17,230
No, I've had it a while. Domenico Vacca.

1588
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,320
I took you for a Kenneth Cole man.

1589
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,540
Kenneth Cole?

1590
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,140
Well, I'm glad you retained your sense of humor.

1591
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,820
You look like a woman who could use some good news.

1592
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:37,120
It's great news.

1593
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:44,100
They've agreed. They're going to take your case.

1594
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,740
It's gonna be an expedited hearing.

1595
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,850
The next case this morning is in re Armstrong.

1596
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:57,400
We'll hear first from Mr. Burnside.

1597
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:04,680
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.

1598
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,520
In 1972 in Branzburg v. Hayes,

1599
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:13,090
this court ruled against the right of reporters

1600
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,830
to withhold the names of their sources before a grand jury,

1601
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:21,460
and it gave the power to the government

1602
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:24,370
to imprison those reporters who did.

1603
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,740
It was a five-four decision. Close.

1604
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:32,810
In his dissent in Branzburg, Justice Stewart said,

1605
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,580
"As the years pass,

1606
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:39,210
"the power of government becomes more and more pervasive."

1607
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:43,550
"Those in power," he said, "whatever their politics,"

1608
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,750
"want only to perpetuate it"

1609
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:50,160
"and the people are the victims."

1610
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:54,790
Well, the years have passed, and that power is pervasive.

1611
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,390
Ms. Armstrong could have 

1612
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:00,100
buckled to the demands of the government.

1613
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,870
She could have abandoned her promise of confidentiality.

1614
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:06,440
She could have simply gone home to her family.

1615
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,450
But to do so

1616
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:12,620
would mean that no source would ever speak to her again,

1617
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:16,490
and no source would ever speak to her newspaper again,

1618
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,670
and then tomorrow 

1619
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:20,790
when we lock up journalists from other newspapers,

1620
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,200
we'll make those publications irrelevant as well,

1621
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:30,670
and thus we'll make the First Amendment irrelevant.

1622
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,740
And then how will we know if a president has covered up crimes?

1623
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:40,870
Or if an army officer has condoned torture?

1624
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:43,930
We, as a nation, 

1625
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:47,410
will no longer be able to hold those in power accountable

1626
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,890
to those whom they have power over.

1627
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:56,320
And what then is the nature of government

1628
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,030
when it has no fear of accountability?

1629
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,770
We should shudder at the thought.

1630
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:08,780
Imprisoning journalists? That's for other countries.

1631
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:13,940
That's for countries who fear their citizens,

1632
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:19,050
not countries that cherish and protect them.

1633
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:23,850
Some time ago,

1634
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:29,320
I began to feel the personal human pressure 

1635
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,730
on Rachel Armstrong,

1636
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,460
and I told her that I was there to represent her 

1637
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,910
and not a principle.

1638
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:48,130
And it was not until I met her 

1639
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:50,040
that I realized that with great people,

1640
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:56,720
there's no difference between principle and the person.

1641
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:14,640
Come on. I got new digs for you.

1642
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:21,310
You know, they brought him out here...        It's nothing.

1643
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,680
He's not a real person here.

1644
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,990
Soccer isn't a real thing here.

1645
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:25,190
They don't respond to it the same way.

1646
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,220
Judge, good afternoon.        It's just not.

1647
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:31,050
Good afternoon, thanks for coming over.

1648
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:32,720
Mr. Burnside.

1649
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:37,100
We're talking about soccer not law. Just want you to know.

1650
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,070
Look, the reason I asked the two of you to come over here today

1651
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,500
is that the Supremes have decided your case.

1652
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:46,070
The ruling will be down on Monday,

1653
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:50,610
but I've been told by a confidential source what it is,

1654
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:53,550
and I wanted to share it with you.

1655
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:56,640
Five-four, opinion against you, Albert.

1656
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,890
Same as before. National security, First Amendment,

1657
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,920
the court went with national security.

1658
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,610
And I want to say to you, Patton, congratulations.

1659
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:08,690
You did a great job.

1660
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,730
The court once again

1661
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,370
has made clear that in a case 

1662
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:15,860
where journalists are not cooperative,

1663
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,910
they may have to be incarcerated.

1664
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:19,740
Well, thank you, sir.

1665
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,910
That having been said,

1666
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,240
I've decided to let her go.

1667
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:33,220
I'm sorry, sir. What?

1668
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:37,160
I've gotta let her go. I've been doing this a lot of years now,

1669
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:42,060
and I am sure that this woman is not going to reveal her source.

1670
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,290
She's been locked up for almost a year.

1671
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:48,030
She has been beaten within an inch of her life.

1672
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:52,440
She is resolute.        That's exactly right. Exactly right.

1673
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:53,840
I can only keep her in jail 

1674
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,070
if I think doing so will get her to reveal her source.

1675
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,480
She's not going to talk. 

1676
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,340
I really have no choice but to let her go.

1677
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,350
If I may. This is a...

1678
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:07,080
This is a woman who's been protecting a criminal.

1679
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,870
That makes her a criminal.

1680
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:11,460
Oh, come on. She's not a criminal,

1681
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,580
and she won't be a criminal

1682
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:17,930
unless she is duly charged and duly convicted by a jury,

1683
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:20,500
and that's not my call.

1684
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,030
When are you gonna sign the paperwork, Your Honor?

1685
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,600
I want to get her out of there right away.

1686
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:25,900
I'm gonna go to court Monday morning.

1687
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,740
I'm gonna announce that I'm freeing her.

1688
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,770
And, Patton, you got a choice. You can beat me to the punch.

1689
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:34,150
Just dissolve the grand jury.

1690
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,820
As I'm sure your attorney has informed you,

1691
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:40,860
the grand jury has been disbanded.

1692
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:43,650
We're gonna have to wait till midnight to let you go.

1693
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,630
Midnight?

1694
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,500
What? You're keeping the reporters away from your losing cause?

1695
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,370
Rachel, I know almost all of it.

1696
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:58,360
I am indicting two government officials for talking to you.

1697
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,770
I wish I knew who it was that first tipped you off,

1698
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,580
but I'm not gonna get greedy.

1699
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,280
I'm losing custody of my kid.

1700
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,190
You want the wedding ring?

1701
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,250
Kind of a trophy.

1702
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,620
You know, vilify me if you want, Rachel,

1703
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:28,000
but I had a job to do, and I had every right to do what I did.

1704
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,290
I think you're confusing 

1705
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:32,130
your rights with your power, Mr. Dubois.

1706
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:47,050
It's okay.

1707
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:53,650
We booked you a room at the Mayflower,

1708
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:57,030
but you know you're welcome to stay with me as long as you need.

1709
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:00,540
Thank you. Thanks.         Sure.

1710
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,370
I spoke to Ray.

1711
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,530
He's gonna bring Timmy by first thing in the morning.

1712
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:08,480
Thought maybe you would like to take him to school?

1713
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:09,810
Yeah.

1714
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,020
That's okay?        Yeah.

1715
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:17,750
That'd be amazing.

1716
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,020
God, I'm gonna scare him to death, though.

1717
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:28,060
And, well, you let me know what you want to do in terms of work.

1718
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:29,430
You can if you want to.

1719
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,930
No one's going to pressure you about 

1720
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,760
writing about your experiences.

1721
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:37,300
Oh, please.

1722
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:38,430
Rachel, look in the glove,

1723
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:41,870
hand me the insurance and registration, would you?

1724
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:44,070
I was only going 30.

1725
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,720
Ma'am, would you please step outside of the car?

1726
01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:00,260
What's going on?        We just need you to step out.

1727
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,850
Not you, ma'am.

1728
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,870
Are you kidding me?        Get out of the car, Rachel.

1729
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,560
What's the problem, sir?        I can't believe this.

1730
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,410
What do you want?

1731
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:09,730
I'm gonna ask you to turn around, please.

1732
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:13,330
What is it? What are you doing?        Hey, hey! Go easy on her.

1733
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:15,980
Rachel, I'm sorry that it's come to this.

1734
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:17,810
What is going on?        Back in the car, ma'am.

1735
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,210
Rachel, you're being charged with...

1736
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,180
What's going on here?        They're arresting me, Bonnie.

1737
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,010
You're being charged with criminal contempt of court.

1738
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:24,250
What does that mean?

1739
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,320
Well, it means you have obstructed justice, 

1740
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,850
and you're going on trial.

1741
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:32,290
Come on. Let's go.        Hasn't she been through enough?

1742
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,660
God damn it.

1743
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,140
Oh, no. God.

1744
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,670
Dubois! Dubois!

1745
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,810
Rachel, you're looking at a possible five-year sentence

1746
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,510
for impeding a federal investigation,

1747
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:56,810
but I don't wanna go to trial.

1748
01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:00,260
So, I want to give you a chance to plead this sentence down.

1749
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:05,820
I want you to look in my eyes and gauge my sincerity.

1750
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,700
Use your reporter's instincts. Okay? You're good with those.

1751
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,470
I'm gonna offer you two years.        No. No.

1752
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:19,030
No, it's gonna be suspended sentence, probation.

1753
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,740
You have to respect what she's been through.

1754
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,210
Albert, two years is not as good an offer as it could be,

1755
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,840
but it's not as bad, either.

1756
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,850
Because you're guilty, Miss Armstrong. You're guilty as charged,

1757
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,260
and if you want to waltz into a courtroom in a martyr's cloak,

1758
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,460
trust me, you're gonna see something that you have not seen yet.

1759
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:45,190
Because this polite, country lawyer demeanor

1760
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:48,790
is gonna give way to a wave of self-righteous indignation

1761
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:51,500
that you can't even begin to imagine.

1762
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:54,300
That jury is gonna hear fire-breathing oratory

1763
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:58,070
about a country whose security has been compromised,

1764
01:35:58,150 --> 01:35:59,710
a husband widowed, 

1765
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:02,640
and a little girl who's gotta visit her mother's grave

1766
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:05,920
because you wanted to chase a Pulitzer Prize.

1767
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,550
So, if you force me to take you to trial,

1768
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,520
I'm gonna make sure that you don't make it home

1769
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,530
for your son's high school graduation.

1770
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:18,590
Come on, that's enough.

1771
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:22,660
So, what's it gonna be, Rachel?

1772
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:31,170
If I agree to this, there is one thing I need.

1773
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,580
Oh, my God. You have gotten so handsome.

1774
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,740
You're a real little man.

1775
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:41,020
I'll bet you got all the girls chasing after you, huh?

1776
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:42,850
No.

1777
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,950
No? Well, you will.

1778
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:47,090
I don't care. Whatever.

1779
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,690
Hey, I kind of like your hair this way.

1780
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:56,530
Look, I know you're mad at me.        No, I'm not.

1781
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,230
Well, I think you are, and

1782
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:02,070
 I haven't let you see me in a long time.

1783
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:04,670
I'd be mad at me, too.        Well, I'm not. Okay?

1784
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,840
Okay.

1785
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:09,280
Look, kiddo, it hasn't been easy for me, either.

1786
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:10,780
If I'd known it was gonna go on this long,

1787
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:12,010
I would have done things differently.

1788
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:15,020
I would have let you see me every single day.

1789
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:19,750
I am so sorry.

1790
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,960
Dad says you could have got out of here many times.

1791
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:26,000
Well, your dad is wrong.

1792
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:32,760
Look, kiddo...        I'm not a kid anymore.

1793
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,610
Okay, you know what? 

1794
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:35,570
You can pretend not to love me all you want,

1795
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,140
and I can pretend to believe it,

1796
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:41,680
but I love you,

1797
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:45,520
and I think about you every minute of every day.

1798
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,350
Okay?

1799
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:49,820
Dad says you're going to prison.

1800
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:54,050
I am.        Isn't that where you are now?

1801
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:55,490
No. This is jail.

1802
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,690
Jail is where you go when they decide your punishment,

1803
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,670
and then you go to prison.

1804
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:02,600
And what's your punishment?

1805
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:06,140
Two years.        That's a long time.

1806
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,410
Yeah. But if I'm well-behaved, then I might get out earlier.

1807
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:12,500
So...

1808
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:14,810
Is it dangerous there?

1809
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:19,680
You know what? If you visit me, come check on me,

1810
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,750
I'll be okay.

1811
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,530
Okay. I'm kind of busy, but I'll try.

1812
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:33,700
I think we should go now, on account of traffic and all.

1813
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:37,210
Hey, hey, how about a kiss? Just one.

1814
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:03,760
Bye.

1815
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:01,110
You're a tattletale!

1816
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,760
I am not!        You just told on Nicky.

1817
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:06,090
That's because he won't stop.

1818
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,260
You're a tattletale.        Timmy, that's enough. Stop it.

1819
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,460
That's enough.        But you're not supposed to tattle.

1820
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:12,490
Well, you're not supposed to 

1821
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:15,160
have to put up with bullies, either.

1822
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:18,140
Come on. Come on.

1823
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:22,400
Are you a writer or something?

1824
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,940
Yeah, I'm a reporter. I work for the Capital Sun Times.

1825
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,480
We get that newspaper.

1826
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,570
Oh, yeah? Well, tell all your friends to do the same.

1827
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:31,030
The Internet is killing us.

1828
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:33,880
Mom, how long till we get there?

1829
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:37,480
About 18 hours, Timmy.        No, Mom, really.

1830
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:40,520
I don't know. I don't know.

1831
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:45,860
My daddy is a writer.

1832
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:48,840
He is? What does he write?        He writes articles,

1833
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,900
though my mom doesn't really like what he writes about.

1834
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:55,340
What's he write about?        He writes about the President.

1835
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:58,370
What's your last name?        Van Doren.

1836
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,210
Why doesn't your mommy like what he writes about?

1837
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:05,220
I heard her yelling at Daddy once.

1838
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:08,690
'Cause he used her secret stuff, she found out.

1839
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:09,770
What she found out?

1840
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:11,850
When she was in Venezula.

1841
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:16,760
Why was your mom in Venezuela? Was she on vacation?

1842
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:19,560
No, she was working..

1843
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,730
Working?        For the government.

1844
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:27,400
But don't tell anybody it's me who told you. Okay?

1845
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,710
You bet.
